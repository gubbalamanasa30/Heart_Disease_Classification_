## ‚öôÔ∏è Methodology
1. **Dataset**: BRFSS 2015 (253,680 records, 22 variables).
2. **Preprocessing**:
   - Addressed severe class imbalance (~9.4% positives) using undersampling.
   - Standardized numerical features (BMI, Age, MentHlth, PhysHlth).
   - Created second-order polynomial and interaction terms.
3. **Models Applied**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree
   - Naive Bayes
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC.

## üìä Key Findings
- **Naive Bayes** achieved the best performance on the balanced dataset:
  - F1 Score = 0.985  
  - AUC = 0.999  
- **Logistic Regression with interaction terms** provided the most balanced performance after fine-tuning.  
- Class imbalance significantly impacted results, proving the importance of balancing strategies.
